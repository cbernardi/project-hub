Project Hub Siteleaf Port
=========================

This a port of Project Hub for users of the [Siteleaf CMS](http://www.siteleaf.com/). I have a [live demo](http://simplyand.com/projecthub/demo-site/) up on my site. Thanks to [@brad_frost](https://twitter.com/brad_frost) for the inspiration and [@siteleaf](https://twitter.com/siteleaf) and [@destroytoday](https://twitter.com/destroytoday) for the technical help.

## To use:
1 Add files to your theme in the corresponding folders
2 Create a top level page called *Project Path*. Make sure the slug is *projectpath*.
3 For a new project, create a subpage fo Project Path. The name of this oage will be the name of the project.
4 Each post created under this project page will show up on the timeline.
5 Multiple projects can be created by simply creating new Project Path subpages.

## TODO:
- Add back in the View etc links. (Need to figure out the best way to accomplish this.)

This is an HTML template for online project timelines (also known as "project hubs").

## What is a project hub and why would I use one?
A project hub is a tool for keeping track of the progress of a design project. The hub lives online (either publically available or password protected), so that everyone involved in the team has access to it.

The benefits of using a project hub:
- Serves as a centralized place for the project's key design/development materials
- Easily and visually view project progress
- Provides an archive for project artifacts
- Keep clients and team members up to speed with design progress
- Lives at a URL that doesn't change
